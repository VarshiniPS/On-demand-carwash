<p>Water Wash is an alternative to the regular everyday wash.
Application of shampoo, which is not generally used in the regular everyday wash, softens the dirt, making it easy the clean without the formation of scratches of swirl marks. Vacuuming the interiors ensures cleaning of dust and particles even in the corners, which is difficult to clean.
 Enjoy the experience!</p>

<p>₹ 4000</p>
<p>Waterless wash is done by spraying of ecofriendly solution on the surface of the exterior body of the car, which forms a lubricating layer between the surface and the dirt allowing the dirt to be picked up by the microfibre cloth without formation of scratches on the surface.
If the vehicle is too muddy or dirty, we suggest going for the water wash. Enjoy the experience!

        <p>After a clean wash for the car, it is important to protect the surface from fine dust,which causes minor scratches, eventually forming swirl marks.
        Application of wax on the surface not only gives the car a shiny finish, but also acts as a protective layer, preventing contaminations on the surface. Enjoy the experience!</p>
